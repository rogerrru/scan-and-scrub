            "description": "TAHBS (Total Abdominal Hysterectomy) and TAHBSO (Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy), involves surgically removing the uterus through an abdominal incision, either transverse or vertical, performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon ligates the uterine vessels and carefully separates the uterus from its supporting ligaments and vaginal attachments. In a TAHBSO, the fallopian tubes and ovaries are also removed. The vaginal cuff is then closed, and the abdominal layers are sutured for closure. The abdominal approach is typically chosen when the uterus is enlarged, when malignancy is suspected, or when other conditions such as adhesions limit access through the vaginal route ( variations in surgical techniques exist) (Cuenca et al, 2021).",
            "indications": "Enlarged uterus (e.g., large fibroids), suspected malignancy (uterine, cervical, or ovarian cancer), adhesions, endometriosis, prior surgeries limiting vaginal access, abnormal uterine bleeding unresponsive to other treatments, adenomyosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine prolapse (in some cases).",

The process involves dividing muscles, ligating blood vessels to control bleeding, carefully cutting nerves, and transecting bone at a specific level. The remaining skin and soft tissue are then used to create flaps to cover the end of the bone, forming a stump that will interface with a prosthesis (Sarwal & Gupta, 2024).",

This surgery is done to find the cause of problems (such as pain or bleeding) that testing could not diagnose. It's also used when an abdominal injury needs emergency medical care. This surgery uses one large cut (incision). The provider can then see and check the organs inside the abdomen. If the cause of the problem is found during the procedure, then treatment is often done at the same time. In some cases, a minimally invasive surgery called exploratory laparoscopy may be used instead. That method uses a tiny camera and several small incisions. But in many cases, an exploratory laparotomy is preferred (Exploratory Laparotomy, n.d.).",

It involves the removal of part or all of the urinary bladder, and, in some cases, surrounding tissues and organs, depending on the extent of the disease. There are two primary types of cystectomy: partial cystectomy, where only a portion of the bladder is removed, and radical cystectomy, where the entire bladder, nearby lymph nodes, and potentially other organs like the prostate, are removed. The choice of procedure is determined by the stage and grade of the cancer, as well as the patient's overall health. This surgery is complex and requires careful consideration of the risks, recovery time, and long-term outcomes.",

Surgeons perform osteotomies to treat various conditions, such as arthritis, joint deformities, or fractures that haven\u2019t healed properly.For example, in a knee osteotomy, the surgeon cuts and repositions the bones to shift weight off a damaged area, helping to delay or prevent the need for a total knee replacement. In hip osteotomies, the procedure can correct congenital deformities or improve joint stability. Osteotomies are also common in orthopedic and dental surgeries, like correcting jaw misalignment or straightening spinal curvatures.After the bone is cut and adjusted, it may be secured with plates, screws, or rods to ensure proper healing. Although recovery can take several months, an osteotomy can significantly improve mobility, reduce pain, and enhance quality of life for patients with musculoskeletal issues.",

Additionally, they may be performed for spinal conditions like scoliosis or kyphosis, to correct jaw misalignment in orthognathic surgery, or as part of reconstructive procedures for tumors or trauma.

It may be done for benign or malignant masses. The surgeon makes an incision over or near the mass, carefully dissects around it to remove the entire lesion, and sends it for pathology. The goal is to excise the mass with clean margins while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible. This procedure is often done under local or general anesthesia and can be combined with imaging techniques like wire localization for small, hard-to-palpate masses (Karakas & Yildirim, 2022).",

Cysts are fluid-filled sacs, while lipomas are benign fatty tumors. The surgeon makes incisions over each mass, carefully dissects through the layers of tissue, and removes the cyst or lipoma along with its capsule to prevent recurrence. For deeper masses, more extensive dissection may be necessary, sometimes involving muscles or nerves. Depending on the number and size of the masses, this procedure can take longer and may require general anesthesia. After removal, the incisions are sutured, and the tissues are sent for pathology to rule out malignancy (Sabir et al., 2024)",

There are numerous indications for joint fluid aspiration, the most important of which includes the evaluation of synovial fluid for evidence of infection or inflammation. While the procedure specifics vary depending on the joint being aspirated, the general technique and steps remain consistent. The procedure tends to be very safe overall with few complications if performed correctly, and only a small number of contraindications exist (Tantillo et al., 2023).",

A small incision is then made to expose the chosen artery and vein, allowing the surgeon to surgically connect them. This connection redirects blood flow from the artery into the vein, increasing blood volume within the vein. Over time, this increased flow causes the vein to enlarge and its walls to thicken, preparing it for hemodialysis. The fistula typically takes several weeks, or in some cases a month or longer, to mature before it can be used for dialysis treatment (AV Fistula Creation for Dialysis | AV Fistula Placement, 2019).

It allows the bone to grow back together with better alignment. Traction to pull the fragments apart is provided either manually involving two people or with a mechanical device such as 'finger\u2010traps' attached to two or more fingers and a counterweight suspended over the upper arm. The reduced fracture is then stabilised, typically by plaster cast immobilisation, to help it to heal. This procedure can be performed by an orthopedic surgeon (bone doctor), an emergency room physician, or a primary care provider who has the necessary training and experience (Handoll & Madhok, 2003).",

It is one of the most common life-saving emergency procedures performed worldwide. Colostomies may be done for emergency or elective surgical conditions to manage a wide range of congenital and acquired benign or malignant gastrointestinal conditions. The procedure serves two main purposes: diversion and decompression. Diversion is performed to prevent contamination of the distal large bowel segment by stool and its associated complications, commonly indicated in cases of trauma or distal rectal elective surgeries. Decompression, on the other hand, is done to relieve an obstructed large bowel, such as in cases of sigmoid volvulus or malignant left-sided tumors. During the procedure, the patient is placed under general anesthesia, and a segment of the colon is exteriorized through the abdominal wall, where it is secured to the skin to create a stoma.

This is typically done when peripheral veins are difficult to locate or access, such as in emergencies or critically ill patients. The procedure allows healthcare providers to place a catheter or cannula directly into the vessel for administering fluids, medications, or blood products. It can also be used for invasive monitoring or during surgeries when rapid, reliable access is needed. The saphenous vein in the ankle is a common site for venous cutdowns, but other vessels can be used depending on the situation. After locating the vein, it\u2019s carefully isolated, incised, and cannulated. Once the catheter is secured, the incision is closed, and the access is maintained for as long as necessary (Mousa et al., 2023).",

Cutaneous abscesses are pus-filled pockets that form in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue, commonly occurring in the groin, buttocks, axillae, and extremities. They are typically identified by erythema, induration, tenderness, and fluctuance. It is important to distinguish abscesses from cellulitis, which is treated with antibiotics alone and lacks fluctuance. When clinical findings are unclear, ultrasonography can help confirm the presence, size, and location of an abscess (Pastorino & Tavarez, 2023).",

            "description": "Wound debridement is a vital procedure in wound management that involves removing devitalized tissue to promote healing. By eliminating necrotic tissue, biofilm, bioburden, and senescent cells, debridement prepares the wound bed for re-epithelialization and enhances the effectiveness of topical treatments. Necrotic tissue can provide nutrients for bacteria, act as a barrier to new tissue growth, and prevent angiogenesis, granulation, and extracellular matrix formation. Additionally, it can obscure the wound's true depth and severity, potentially hiding underlying infections. Regular debridement at each patient visit supports optimal wound healing (Manna et al., 2023).",

The objective of this procedure for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is to relieve the urinary obstruction, minimize harm to surrounding tissues, and ensure minimal discomfort for the patient. Using a resectoscope allows the obstruction to be removed transcystoscopically through the urethra, which reduces the risk of injury to nearby organs. This method also avoids the potential spread of cancerous cells associated with open surgery, as tissue is extracted through the urinary tract rather than through an abdominal incision (Goldman, 2008).",
