            "description": "TAHBS (Total Abdominal Hysterectomy) and TAHBSO (Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy), involves surgically removing the uterus through an abdominal incision, either transverse or vertical, performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon ligates the uterine vessels and carefully separates the uterus from its supporting ligaments and vaginal attachments. In a TAHBSO, the fallopian tubes and ovaries are also removed. The vaginal cuff is then closed, and the abdominal layers are sutured for closure. The abdominal approach is typically chosen when the uterus is enlarged, when malignancy is suspected, or when other conditions such as adhesions limit access through the vaginal route ( variations in surgical techniques exist) (Cuenca et al, 2021).",
            "indications": "Enlarged uterus (e.g., large fibroids), suspected malignancy (uterine, cervical, or ovarian cancer), adhesions, endometriosis, prior surgeries limiting vaginal access, abnormal uterine bleeding unresponsive to other treatments, adenomyosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine prolapse (in some cases).",

            "description": "A craniotomy is a surgical procedure where a section of the skull (a bone flap) is temporarily removed to access the brain. This procedure is performed for various reasons, including treating brain tumors, aneurysms, traumatic injuries, or hemorrhages. After making an incision in the scalp, the surgeon drills small burr holes into the skull, then uses a special saw to cut and lift a section of bone. Once the brain surgery is complete, the bone flap is replaced and secured with plates or screws. Craniotomies can be small (keyhole) or large, depending on the underlying condition. Specialized variations include the burr hole procedure, awake craniotomy, and stereotactic craniotomy (Akhigbe & Zolnourian, 2017).",
            "indications": "A craniotomy is indicated for brain tumors (for biopsy or resection), traumatic brain injury with hematoma or swelling, cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM), epilepsy surgery (when seizures don\u2019t respond to medication), hydrocephalus (for shunt placement or third ventriculostomy), and brain abscess or severe infection requiring drainage.",

It may be done for benign or malignant masses. The surgeon makes an incision over or near the mass, carefully dissects around it to remove the entire lesion, and sends it for pathology. The goal is to excise the mass with clean margins while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible. This procedure is often done under local or general anesthesia and can be combined with imaging techniques like wire localization for small, hard-to-palpate masses (Karakas & Yildirim, 2022).",

Cysts are fluid-filled sacs, while lipomas are benign fatty tumors. The surgeon makes incisions over each mass, carefully dissects through the layers of tissue, and removes the cyst or lipoma along with its capsule to prevent recurrence. For deeper masses, more extensive dissection may be necessary, sometimes involving muscles or nerves. Depending on the number and size of the masses, this procedure can take longer and may require general anesthesia. After removal, the incisions are sutured, and the tissues are sent for pathology to rule out malignancy (Sabir et al., 2024)",

In some cases, a minimally invasive surgery called exploratory laparoscopy may be used instead. That method uses a tiny camera and several small incisions.

            "description": "Toe or finger amputation involves surgically removing a digit at a specific level, ranging from partial to complete removal at the metatarsophalangeal/metacarpophalangeal joint. Typically performed under local, regional, or general anesthesia, the procedure begins with a circumferential incision around the digit. The surgeon carefully dissects through skin, subcutaneous tissue, tendons, and ligaments. Blood vessels are ligated to control bleeding, and nerves are transected, often with consideration for minimizing neuroma formation. The bone is divided, smoothed, and the skin and soft tissue are used to create a flap to cover the bone, ensuring adequate padding. The flap is sutured closed, and a sterile dressing is applied (Pinzur, 2017). ",

            "description": "A closed reduction, often termed manipulation, is a non-surgical procedure used to set (reduce) a broken bone or dislocated joint without making an incision. It allows the bone to grow back together with better alignment. Traction to pull the fragments apart is provided either manually involving two people or with a mechanical device such as 'finger\u2010traps' attached to two or more fingers and a counterweight suspended over the upper arm. The reduced fracture is then stabilised, typically by plaster cast immobilisation, to help it to heal. This procedure can be performed by an orthopedic surgeon (bone doctor), an emergency room physician, or a primary care provider who has the necessary training and experience (Handoll & Madhok, 2003).",
            "indications": "A closed reduction is indicated for displaced fractures without open wounds, joint dislocations (e.g., shoulder, hip, or fingers), minimally comminuted fractures that can be realigned non-surgically, pediatric fractures to avoid growth plate damage, and initial fracture management in emergencies to relieve pain, restore circulation, or prevent nerve damage before definitive fixation.",

            "description": "A colostomy is a surgical procedure in which a portion of the large intestine (colon) is brought through the anterior abdominal wall to create an artificial opening (stoma) for the elimination of stool. It is one of the most common life-saving emergency procedures performed worldwide. Colostomies may be done for emergency or elective surgical conditions to manage a wide range of congenital and acquired benign or malignant gastrointestinal conditions. The procedure serves two main purposes: diversion and decompression. Diversion is performed to prevent contamination of the distal large bowel segment by stool and its associated complications, commonly indicated in cases of trauma or distal rectal elective surgeries. Decompression, on the other hand, is done to relieve an obstructed large bowel, such as in cases of sigmoid volvulus or malignant left-sided tumors. During the procedure, the patient is placed under general anesthesia, and a segment of the colon is exteriorized through the abdominal wall, where it is secured to the skin to create a stoma. (Engida et al., 2016)",
            "indications": "A colostomy is indicated for bowel obstruction or perforation, colorectal cancer, diverticulitis with complications (e.g., abscess or perforation), inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., severe Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis), traumatic bowel injury, congenital anomalies (e.g., imperforate anus), and fecal incontinence or severe perineal wounds requiring stool diversion for healing.",

            "description": "A cutdown surgery is a minor surgical procedure where a small incision is made in the skin and underlying tissues to gain direct access to a blood vessel, usually a vein. This is typically done when peripheral veins are difficult to locate or access, such as in emergencies or critically ill patients. The procedure allows healthcare providers to place a catheter or cannula directly into the vessel for administering fluids, medications, or blood products. It can also be used for invasive monitoring or during surgeries when rapid, reliable access is needed. The saphenous vein in the ankle is a common site for venous cutdowns, but other vessels can be used depending on the situation. After locating the vein, it\u2019s carefully isolated, incised, and cannulated. Once the catheter is secured, the incision is closed, and the access is maintained for as long as necessary (Mousa et al., 2023).",
            "indications": "A cutdown surgery is indicated for emergency vascular access when peripheral veins are collapsed or inaccessible (e.g., severe dehydration, shock, trauma), the need for rapid, reliable IV access for fluid resuscitation, blood transfusion, or medication delivery, long-term venous access when central line placement is challenging or unavailable, and intraoperative access for complex surgeries requiring continuous monitoring or medication infusion.",

They are typically identified by erythema, induration, tenderness, and fluctuance. It is important to distinguish abscesses from cellulitis, which is treated with antibiotics alone and lacks fluctuance. When clinical findings are unclear, ultrasonography can help confirm the presence, size, and location of an abscess (Pastorino & Tavarez, 2023).",

Necrotic tissue can provide nutrients for bacteria, act as a barrier to new tissue growth, and prevent angiogenesis, granulation, and extracellular matrix formation. Additionally, it can obscure the wound's true depth and severity, potentially hiding underlying infections. Regular debridement at each patient visit supports optimal wound healing (Manna et al., 2023).",

Using a resectoscope allows the obstruction to be removed transcystoscopically through the urethra, which reduces the risk of injury to nearby organs. This method also avoids the potential spread of cancerous cells associated with open surgery, as tissue is extracted through the urinary tract rather than through an abdominal incision (Goldman, 2008).",
